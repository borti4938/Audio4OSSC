v0.73 and before: just a backup, here

v0.74 and later: The audio firmware was included to the official GitHub repository of marqs85. These firmware files are just a mirror from the official source: https://www.niksula.hut.fi/~mhiienka/ossc/fw/

fw-build with extension "-wextmclk": IT6613E uses the external audio clock. Uses this fw. only if you want to use it (see notes on the main-readme)
