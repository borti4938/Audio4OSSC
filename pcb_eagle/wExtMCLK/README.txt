PCB Production
==============
Choose the service you would ever like. I have uploaded the design to OSHPark, too.
VERY IMPORTANT: The substrate thickness has to be as thin as possible.
The PCB is design to sit between lifted pins of the IT6613 (the HDMI transmitter) and OSSC-PCB. Just look at the installation pictures to get an idea ;)
I have produced the PCBs with OSHPark and have chosen 0.8mm thickness. The PCB must not be thicker.

RC-filtering of the Audio
=========================
The RC filters (R19,C19) and (R20,C20) mainly bandlimits the noise. The filter also avoids aliasing effects if the bandwith of the audio signal increases.
The PCM1808 samples the audio signal with 96kHz. This means that the cut-off frequency of the filters have to be 96kHz or below. The firmware will also allows you to further downsample the datastream to 48kHz. If you want to use that I recommend you to set the filter to 48kHz or below to avoid aliasing.
The cut-off frequency f_c of a simple RC low pass filter is determined by f_c = 1/(2*pi*R*C).
here is my choice which gives a cut-off frequency of 47.938kHz.
