PCB-Installation on a v1.5-A3b Audio PCB
========================================
(This is the version you can buy from VGP)  

Before you start, check the following points:  
- Bought a a v1.3-DIY/DVI OSSC?  
  -> If yes, please consider additional notes.  
  
Now you can start :)  
  
01 - cut three wires between each pair of solder joints marked with I2S, WS and SCK
     -> Note for v1.3: You don't have these jumpers. Lift pins 9, 10 and 11 of the IT6613E.  
02 - demonstration of point 1 on a v1.5-DVI board  
03 - solder the three top solder joints on the OSSC PCB (I2S, WS and SCK) to the audio PCB  
     -> Note for v1.3: Solder lose wires to the lifted pins. Be carefull to not harm the pins!   
   - solder three wires to the SCART plug w (L.in <-> pin 6, GND <-> pin 4, R.in <-> pin 2)
04 - connect the wires for 5V, 3.3V and 27MHz  
05 - 5V and 3.3V can be get from U5
06 - 27MHz from the crystal oscillator (pin between U7 and U9)
